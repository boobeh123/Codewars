## Codewars Code of Conduct
Please do not post your solutions on Github (or alike). We realize you would like to use these challenges as your resume, but you should have side-projects for that. If an user is unable to find a solution online, then they are further encouraged to complete the task themselves - which will enable them to get more value out of their time spent.
